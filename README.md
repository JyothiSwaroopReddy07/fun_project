# CeleryTube

This is a youtube video finder which uses celery to run asynchronous tasks and push data into database.
- **Backend:** Django rest framework
- **Asynchronous tasks:** celery, redis server
- **frontend:** Reactjs
- **database:** Sqlite3

## Features
1. Celery to fetch data from youtube every 30 seconds
2. Pushing the data into data base and fetching it.
3. Use filters such as views, likes,comments,favorites, upload date to sort the data in ascending and descending order
4. Implemented Pagination, Search Filter using django-fliters
5. Implemented Dashboard to display the search results
6. Utilized pagination concepts to fetch data in bundle of 10's to frontend
7. Utilized more than 30 API keys of Youtube data v3 api which selects the api key at random and reduce chance of expiration of quota of api requests


## Getting Started

## Redis server Installation

1. Update System Packages
First, update your system's package index. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
```
2. Install Redis Server
Install Redis by executing:

```bash
sudo apt install redis-server
```
This command downloads and installs Redis and its dependencies.

3. Configure Redis (Optional)
By default, Redis is not configured to run as a daemon. To change this, you'll need to edit the Redis configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
```
In this file, find the supervised directive. By default, it is set to no. Change it to systemd:


4. Restart Redis Server
To apply the changes, restart the Redis service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart redis.service
```

5. Enable Redis to Start on Boot
If you want Redis to start automatically when your server boots, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable redis.service
```

## Running Celery and Redis Server

1. Open New Terminal,Go to folder youtube_api
   ```bash
   cd youtube_api
   celery -A youtube_api worker -l info
   ```
2. Open New Terminal Again, Go to folder youtube_api
  ```bash
    cd youtube_api
   celery -A youtube_api beat -l info
   ```
This starts the celery to work


## Running Frontend

1. Redirect to folder Frontend in terminal
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```
The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
